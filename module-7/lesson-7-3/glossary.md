# Glossary - Integration Testing

## Integration Test

**Definition**: A test that verifies multiple components, services, or modules work together correctly.

---

## Workflow Test

**Definition**: Testing a complete user journey or business process across multiple components.

---

## Mock

**Definition**: A fake implementation of a function or API used in tests to isolate the code being tested.

---

## API Mocking

**Definition**: Simulating API responses in tests to avoid real network calls.

---

## Pinia Store Integration

**Definition**: Testing components that use Pinia for state management.

---

## State Management Test

**Definition**: Verifying that shared state updates and flows correctly across components.

---

## Composable Integration

**Definition**: Testing that composable functions work correctly within components.

---

## Async Operation Test

**Definition**: Testing code that performs asynchronous operations (API calls, timers).

---

## Loading State

**Definition**: UI state shown while an asynchronous operation is in progress.

---

## Error State

**Definition**: UI state shown when an operation fails or encounters an error.

---

## Success State

**Definition**: UI state shown when an operation completes successfully.

---

## Mocked Fetch

**Definition**: Replacing the real fetch function with a fake one for testing.

---

## Promise Mocking

**Definition**: Creating fake promises that resolve or reject for testing async code.

---

## Component Composition

**Definition**: Testing how parent and child components work together.

---

## Parent-Child Communication

**Definition**: Testing props passed down and events emitted up between components.

---

## Setups and Teardowns

**Definition**: `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks that prepare and clean up tests.

---

## Test Isolation

**Definition**: Ensuring each test is independent and doesn't affect other tests.

---

## Fresh State

**Definition**: Starting each test with a clean, initialized state (fresh Pinia store).

---

## Realistic Scenario

**Definition**: Testing code in conditions similar to actual usage.

---

## End-to-End-Like

**Definition**: Integration tests that feel similar to E2E tests but run faster.
