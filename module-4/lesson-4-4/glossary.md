# Glossary: Advanced Routing Patterns

**Module 4, Lesson 4.4**

---

## Lazy Loading
Loading route components on-demand rather than in initial bundle. Reduces initial load time.

## Code Splitting
Dividing application into smaller chunks that can be loaded separately.

## Named Views
Multiple `<router-view>` components with names, allowing different components for same route.

## Route Transitions
Animations between route changes using Vue's transition system.

## Dynamic Routes
Routes added/removed at runtime using router API methods.

## Prefetching
Loading route components in advance during browser idle time.

## Chunk
Separate JavaScript file containing one or more lazily-loaded components.
