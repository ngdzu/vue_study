# Appendix A.1 — Functional Programming Fundamentals

## Overview
Master functional programming concepts essential for modern Vue development. Learn array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and `flatMap()` that are used throughout the course and in real-world Vue applications.

## Learning Goals
- Understand pure functions and functional programming principles
- Master array transformation methods: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Learn higher-order functions and function composition
- Apply functional patterns in real Vue components
- Recognize when to use each array method

## What You Will Learn

### Core Array Methods
- **`map()`** — Transform each element
- **`filter()`** — Select elements matching a condition
- **`reduce()`** — Accumulate values into a single result
- **`flatMap()`** — Map and flatten in one operation
- **`find()` / `findIndex()`** — Locate elements
- **`some()` / `every()`** — Boolean checks across arrays

### Why This Matters
Vue components often need to:
- Transform lists of data for display (`map()`)
- Filter products by category (`filter()`)
- Calculate totals or aggregates (`reduce()`)
- Chain multiple operations efficiently

## Prerequisites
- Basic JavaScript (variables, functions, arrays)
- Understanding of ES6 arrow functions

## Materials
- [lesson.md](lesson.md) — Comprehensive explanations with examples
- [glossary.md](glossary.md) — Quick reference for terms
- [quiz.md](quiz.md) — Knowledge check questions
- [quiz-answers.md](quiz-answers.md) — Detailed answers

## Estimated Time
45-60 minutes

## Key Takeaways
By the end, you'll be able to:
- Transform data with `map()` instead of imperative loops
- Chain methods for complex transformations
- Recognize which method solves which problem
- Write cleaner, more maintainable Vue component code
