# Glossary: JavaScript Object Mechanics

- Prototype: The object used as a fallback during property lookup via the `[[Prototype]]` chain.
- Constructor: Function or `class` used with `new` to create instances and set prototypes.
- Instance: Object created from a constructor/class; inherits from its prototype.
- Inheritance: Mechanism where objects delegate property/method lookup to their prototype chain.
- `super`: Keyword to refer to parent prototype methods inside class methods.
- Own Property: Property directly on the object (not via prototype).
- Enumerable: Descriptor flag controlling whether a property appears in `for...in`, `Object.keys`.
- Writable: Descriptor flag controlling assignment ability for a property’s value.
- Configurable: Descriptor flag controlling redefinition and deletion of a property.
- Getter/Setter: Accessor properties that run functions on read/write.
- Spread Operator (`...`): Syntax to unpack object properties into a new object (shallow clone).
- Destructuring: Syntax to extract properties from an object into named variables.
- `Object.assign(target, ...sources)`: Copies enumerable properties from sources to target.
- Shallow Copy: Copy where nested objects are still referenced (not deeply cloned).
- Reflection: Uniform function-based object operations via `Reflect.*`.
- Proxy: Wrapper that intercepts fundamental operations on a target.
- Trap: A handler method on a proxy (e.g., `get`, `set`, `has`).
- Target: The underlying object/function wrapped by a proxy.
- Handler: Object providing trap implementations for the proxy.
- Revocable Proxy: A proxy that can be disabled later via `revoke()`.
- `Object.create(proto)`: Creates an object with a specified prototype.
- `Object.hasOwn(obj, key)`: Checks for an own property (no prototype chain).
- Property Descriptor: Object describing property attributes (value, enumerable, etc.).
- Own Keys: All own property keys (strings + symbols), from `Reflect.ownKeys`.
